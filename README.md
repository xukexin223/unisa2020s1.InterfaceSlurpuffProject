### Simple Git Usage

For reference, the basic flow of uploading changes to git is: 
1. Stage your changes (`git add -A` will add all changes, `git add {file}` will add a specific file)
2. Commit your changes (`git commit -m '{message}'`)
3. Push your changes (`git push`)
    1. If necessary, deal with any merge conflicts (message the group if you're having trouble)

Then, before starting to code you should always pull changes from the repo, this will reduce conflicts and keep your local project up to date. To do this simple use `git pull`, again you may have merge conflicts, message the group if you have issues.
